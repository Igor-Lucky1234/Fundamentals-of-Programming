# C++ Programming Lab Assignments

This repository contains solutions to several programming tasks in C++. Each task addresses a specific problem related to working with arrays.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Sum of Positive Numbers
The program prompts the user to input an array of numbers and calculates the sum of only the positive elements.

**Usage:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of elements in the array.
3. Enter the elements of the array.
4. The program will output the sum of the positive numbers.

### Task 2: Search for a Given Number
The program checks if a predefined number is present in the array entered by the user.

**Usage:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of elements in the array.
3. Enter the elements of the array.
4. Enter the number to search for.
5. The program will indicate whether the number is found in the array.

### Task 3: Elements Exceeding a Given Number
The program fills an array with random numbers and counts the number of elements that exceed a user-specified number.

**Usage:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of elements in the array.
3. Enter the number for comparison.
4. The program will output the count of elements that exceed this number.

### Task 4: Fibonacci Numbers
The program fills an array with Fibonacci numbers and displays them on the screen.

**Usage:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of elements in the array.
3. The program will output the sequence of Fibonacci numbers.

### Task 5: Even Elements of an Array
The program outputs only the even elements of an array entered by the user.

**Usage:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of elements in the array.
3. Enter the elements of the array.
4. The program will output only the even elements.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (such as g++ or MinGW for Windows).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
